# NFC Bot
This repository contains code for a remote control robot. A basestation will use an NFC card reader to read commands from NFC tags, and send them to the robot. Documentation can be found in the wiki here: https://github.com/SamGriffen/NFCBot/wiki

# TO DO
- Calibration needs to be improved. Currently there is no calibration setting for making the robot travel in a straight line, this will be important. Ideally this is done with motor encoders, but can just be done as a constant that is tuned manually as well.
